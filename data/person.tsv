It was given in 1967 by the RATP (Régie autonome des transports parisiens) to commemorate the collaboration of French and Canadian engineers in building the Montréal Métro.   ..Square-Victoria is a station on the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro rapid transit system, operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM).  It was inaugurated on February 6, 1967..Square Victoria (Victoria Square) was built on the empty space at the intersection of Cote du Beaver Hall (Beaver Hall Hill) and McGill Street in 1813.  Formerly known as Place du Marché-à-Foin and Place des Commissaires, it was renamed for Queen Victoria for the visit of the then-Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1860.  Victoria Square has undergone many aesthetic changes over its history, functioning at times more as a parking lot, other times as a simple open space, while at others being far more refined and cultivated. The Square was restored to its current configuration in 2002 and 2003. It features <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/3819671011">a statue of Queen Victoria</a>, and trees lining its bounding avenues.	2126	Bouche de métro Guimard; Guimard; hector guimard; art nouveau; sign; Montréal metro; Montreal metro; metro; Société de transport de Montréal; Societe de transport de Montreal; STM; Montréal; Montreal; Quartier international de Montréal; Quartier international; QIM; International District; Ville Marie; Québec; Quebec; Square Victoria; Victoria Square; canada; Quartier international de Montreal; 	There is a map in the street of the city.	a bus stop map in a city near a water fountain	The subway stop Square Victoria entrance and the map of the neighborhood	A map and street sign with building in background.

Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.&quot;..My iPhone came in the mail today!  Serendipitously, I spent the afternoon on the internet researching various lists of the top iPhone apps and then when I got home, there was my new toy!..Recently I decided it was time I got myself a smartphone.  I don't really talk on my phone that much.  Mostly I use it for going on the internet, texting, and playing games, so smartphones would seem to be perfect for me.  I've been a T-Mobile customer for the past 7 years and I would've gotten a model they offered, but they decided I wasn't eligible for an upgrade discount and were going to charge me $399 for their smartphone.  Hmmm, let's see.... I could stick with T-Mobile and pay $399 for their smartphone, or I could switch to AT&amp;T and get an iPhone for $99... okay then, AT&amp;T it is!  Brilliant business model, T-Mobile...Now if I can just get the activation to kick in on my iPhone I'll be able to play around with it.  ..(August 5, 2009)..P.S. - thanks to Brian for giving me the idea for the title.	5212	iphone; apple; phone; mobile; cellular; smart; smartphone; hand; cell; Project365; 365; August 5, 2009; 	A hand holding a smart phone with apps on a screen.

This sign is coming loose and rattling in the wind.<b>(2)</b> Could you arrange to refix the sign...Lastly you'll notice the 'clutter' of street 'furniture' at this corner. As well as the metal column with the CPZ boundary sign; there's a 20 mph Zone column sign; and a &quot;Give Way&quot; column sign. In the same few metres of pavement there's a green Virgin Media phone cabinet..<b>(3)</b> In the medium and longer term could some thought be given to the possibility of reducing this clutter by e.g. rationalising the signs.<s>.</s>	2973	Mattress; dumped mattress; bed; Parkhust Road; Dowsett Road; Tottenham; Haringey; street furniture; street clutter; dumping; Flickr ban; Flickr block; social media websites; 	Many cars are parked along the sidewalk of a narrow street.

If drivers miss it, they have to go round Tottenham one-way system. (1.4 miles; 2.3 km).</b>  ..I and Sheik Thompson - then my fellow ward councillor raised this. Naturally, I was told by Haringey's staff why this wasn't possible. (There are <i><b>always</b></i> excellent reasons why things are impossible.)  we were told that Monument Way is a &quot;red route&quot; under the control of Transport for London - not Haringey Council. So only Department for Transport direction signs are allowed. ..So I was curious to see that in another part of High Road Tottenham - also a red route and part of the One-Way System<b>*</b> - it appears this restriction doesn't apply. Or perhaps not if an organisation is large and influential enough...____________________________..<b>§</b>  What is a <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/redroutes/10185.aspx" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Red Route</a>?.<b>§</b>   Aerial view of  <a href="http://loc.alize.us/#/flickr:7098368435" rel="noreferrer nofollow">where this photo was taken.</a> .<b>§</b>  <b>*</b> The bus is not driving the wrong way in a one-way street.

Side is a resort town on the southern coast of Turkey, near the villages of Manavgat and Selimiye, 75 km from Antalya) in the province of Antalya. It is located on the eastern part of the Pamphylian coast, which lies about 20 km east of the mouth of the Eurymedon River..Settlers from Cyme (Cumæans) in Aeolis, an ancient region of northwestern Asia Minor, founded the city in the seventh century BC. Possessing a good harbor for small-craft boats, Side's natural geography made it the most important place in Pamphylia – the region in the south of Asia Minor between Lycia and Cilicia, from the Mediterranean to Mount Taurus. This location made Side one of the most important trade centers in its time. Today, as in yesteryear, the ancient city of Side is situated on a small north-south peninsula about 1 km long and 400 m across..Strabo and Arrianos both record that Side was settled from Cyme (Aeolis), city in Aeolia, a region of western Anatolia. Most probably, this colonization occurred in the seventh century B.C.. According to Arrianos, when settlers from Kyme came to Side, they could not understand the dialect. After a short while, the influence of this indigenous tongue was so great that the newcomers forgot their native Greek and started using the language of Side. Excavations have revealed several inscriptions written in this language. The inscriptions, dating from the third and second centuries B.C., remain undeciphered, but testify that the local language was still in use several centuries after colonization. Another object found in Side excavations, a basalt column base from the seventh century B.C. and attributable to the Neo-Hittites, provides other evidence of the site's early history. The word &quot;side&quot; is Anatolian in origin and means pomegranate...Next to no information exists concerning Side under Lydia and Persian Empire sovereignty. Nevertheless, the fact that Side minted its own coins during the 547 BC while under Persian dominion, shows that it still possessed a great measure of independence..Alexander the Great occupied Side without a struggle in 333 BC. Alexander left only a single garrison behind to occupy the city. This occupation, in turn, introduced the people of Side to Hellenistic culture of the Greek Civilization, which flourished from the fourth century to the first century BC. After Alexander's death, Side fell under the control of one of Alexander's generals, Ptolemy I Soter, who declared himself king of Egypt in 305 BC. The Ptolemaic dynasty controlled Side until it was captured by the Seleucid Empire in the second century BC. Yet, despite these occupations, in the following years of the second century BC, Side managed to preserve some autonomy, grew prosperous, and became an important cultural center...In 190 BC a fleet from the Greek island city-state of Rhodes, supported by Rome and Pergamum, defeated the Seleucid King Antiochus the Great's fleet, which was under the command of the fugitive Carthaginian general, Hannibal. The defeat of Hannibal and Antiochus the Great meant that Side freed itself from the overlordship of the Seleucid Empire. The embarrassing Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) forced Antiochus the Great to abandon all European territories and to cede all of Asia Minor north of the Taurus Mountains to Pergamum. However, the dominion of Pergamum only reached de facto as far as Perga, leaving Eastern Pamphylia semi-free. This led Attalus II Philadelphus to construct a new harbour in the city Attalia (the present Antalya), even though Side already had an important harbour. Between 188 and 36 BC Side minted their own money, tetradrachms showing Nike and a laurel wreath (the sign of victory)...In the first century BC, Side reached a peak when the Cilician pirates established their chief naval base and a slave-trade center..The consul Servilius Vatia defeated these brigands in 78 BC and later the Roman general Pompey in 67 BC, bringing Side under the control of the Roman Empire. Side's second peak period started around 2C BC when it established and maintained a good working relationship with the Roman Empire.[2] Emperor Augustus reformed the state administration and placed Pamphylia and Side in the Roman province of Galatia in 25 BC, after the short reign by the king Amyntas of Galatia between 36 and 25 BC. Side began another prosperous period as a commercial center in Asia Minor through its trade in olive oil. Its population grew to 60,000 inhabitants. This period would last well into the third century AD. Side established itself as a slave-trading center in the Mediterranean. Its large commercial fleet engaged in acts of piracy. Wealthy merchants paid for such tributes as public works, monuments, and competitions as well as the games and gladiator fights. The significance of this period for Side is evident in its ruins today. Most of the present-day ruins found in Side date from this period of prosperity..Side began a steady decline from the fourth century on. Even defensive walls could not stop successive invasions of highlanders from the Taurus Mountains. During the fifth and sixth centuries, Side experienced a revival, and became the seat of the Bishopric of Eastern Pamphylia. Arab fleets, nevertheless, raided and burned Side during the seventh century, contributing to its decline. The combination of earthquakes, Christian zealots and Arab raids, left the site completely abandoned by the 10th century. [2] Its citizens had emigrated to nearby Antalya...In the twelfth century, Side temporarily established itself once more as a large city. An inscription found on the site of the former ancient city shows a considerable Jewish population in early Byzantine times. However, Side was abandoned again after being sacked. Its population moved to Antalya, and Side became known as Eski Adalia or Old Antalya and was buried..One of the maps (portolani) Piri Reis, taken from the Kitab-i Bahriye, Piri produced in several editions, supplementing in 1520, but integrating it into subsequent editions..The great ruins are among the most notable in Asia Minor. They cover a large promontory where a wall and a moat separate it from the mainland. During medieval times, the wall and moat were repaired and the promontory houses a wealth of structures...There are colossal ruins of a theater complex, the largest of Pamphylia, built much like a Roman amphitheater that relies on arches to support the sheer verticals. The Roman style was adopted because Side lacked a convenient hillside that could be hollowed out as in the usual Greek fashion more typical of Asia Minor. The theater is less well preserved than the Aspendos theater, but it is almost as large, seating 15,000 - 20,000 people. With time and the shifting of the earth, the scena wall has collapsed over the stage and the proscenium is in a cataract of loose blocks. It was converted into an open-air sanctury with two chapels during Byzantine times (5-6th c.)..The well preserved city walls provide an entrance to the site through the Hellenistic main gate (Megale Pyle) of the ancient city, although this gate from the second century BC is badly damaged. Next comes the colonnaded street although the marble columns once there do not exist anymore. All that remains is a few broken stubs near the old Roman baths. The street leads to the a public bath, restored as a museum displaying Roman period statues and sarcophagi. Next is the square agora with in the middle the remains of the round Tyche and Fortuna temple (2nd c. BC), a periptery with twelve columns. In later times it was used as a trading center where pirates sold slaves. The current remains of the theatre, which was used for gladiator fights and later as a church, and the monumental gate date back to the 2nd century. The early Roman Temple of Dionysus is near the theater. The fountain gracing the entrance is restored. At the left side are the remains of a Byzantine Basilica. A public bath has been restored[2]..The remaining ruins of Side include three temples, an aqueduct, and a nymphaeum. Side's nymphaeum – a grotto with a natural water supply dedicated to the nymphs – was an artificial grotto or fountain building of elaborate design...Turkish archaeologists have been excavating Side since 1947 and intermittently continue to do so..In 1895 Greek Muslim refugees from Crete moved to the ruined town and called it Selimiye. Today, Side has become a popular vacation destination and experiences a new revival...It was a favorite spot for watching the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006...Having been the Bishopric of Eastern Pamphylia, it is still a titular see of the Roman Catholic church.	64979	side; manavgat; turkey; ruin; history; greek; roman; temple; harleydavidson; motorbike; bike; motosiklet; motorsiklet; action; S5IS; motorcycle; turchia; türkiye; turkei; empire; attalia; arab; pamphylia; byzantine; ottoman; ancient; modern; 	A city made out of stone brick with large arches.

Although obsolete by some standards, it proved to be a formidable weapon in the Coral Sea, and the battle for the solomons.  The Dauntless and its brave aircrews are best remembered for sinking all four of the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway, earning the nickname &quot;Slow But Deadly.&quot;  Large dive brakes were built into the trailing edge of the wing.  They were opened for speed control during the near vertical descent towards a target.  When the bomb was dropped, the underbelly Y shaped &quot;trapeze&quot; pivotd forward and down to guide the ordinance past the popeller arc...The SBD-3 Dauntless were equipped with 1,000 horsepower Wright R1820-52 Cyclone 9 cylinder engines.  With a wingspan of 41 feet, 6 inches and a length of 32 feet, 8 inches, they weighed 10,4000 pounds loaded.  They could reach speeds of 250mph and ranged over 1,200 miles.  5,936 of these dive bombers were built by the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force between 1940 and when production ended in July 1944...This aircraft is displayed in the markings of the Dauntless dive bomber that Lt. Richard Best and Aviation Chief Radio man J.F. Murray flew during the attack ont he Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi on June 4, 1942.  Best, a 1932 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy was the commanding officer of Bombing Squadron Six (VB-6) aboard the U.S. carrier Enterprise.  Mid-morning on June 4, Best and two wingmen aborted an attack on the already targeted carrier Kaga, turning instead to attack the nearby carrier Akagi.  While his wingman scored near misses, best placed his 1,000 lb. bomb in the center of the flight deck, dooming the akagi.  Later that afternoon, Lt. Best led his squadron against the carrier Hiryu, which was hit by four 1,000 lb. bombs and blew up in dramatic fashion.  Richard Best never flew again.  His oxygen supply malfunctioned affecting his lungs.   ..The Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor (PAM), located on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor, opened to the public on December 7, 2006.  The first phase of the museum is Hanger 37, a 42,442-square foot former seaplane hangar that survived the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, features a 200-seat theater and a 25,000-square foot exhibit area, which highlights the story of military aviation in the Pacific during World War II.  Future phases will be built Hangar 79 and Hangar 54, telling additional stories of the Korean War, Vietnam War and Cold War...Pearl Harbor, U.S. Naval Base National Historic District National Register #66000940 (1966)	2908	Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless; SBD-3; SBD-3 Dauntless; dauntless; fighter plane; plane; airplane; jet; fighter jet; dive bomber; Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor; Pacific Aviation Museum; museum; ford island; PAM; military museum; hangar 37; pearl harbor; honolulu; Honolulu county; O'ahu; Hawai'i; 	A large propeller plane mounted to the ceiling of a building.

I felt bad enough about cheating with the non-story <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/swimparallel/3497745254">last post</a> that I wrote another one the same night.</em>..When I wake up on my first night in Athens, I debate the merits of the hostel’s 11:30 bar crawl until 11:30 and come down to find out that they’ve already left. Instead I get directions to another place from the man at the front desk of my hostel. He says the area is safe; I don’t think twice. In D.C., I walk fearlessly at nights, because it’s my city and I’ve lived there for almost five years and if someone was going to mess with me, they probably would have done it by now...As soon as I step out into the darkness, reality settles: I’m a silly girl in a foreign city and I’m carrying my wallet in my hand because the only purse I have is a camera/laptop bag and I don’t want to drag that out. In other words, I’m practically wearing a “Mug Me” T-shirt over my sarong. But if I had any sense, my life would probably look a lot different, so I start walking anyway, and I take back alleys to spite my nervousness...I take a right at a kiosk and walk up my first alley. The couple on the left side of the road laughs, throws something onto the sidewalk; I hear the screech of an alley cat. There are stray cats everywhere here and I want to take all of them home. They take off on their moped and I keep walking...The bar the man sent me to is closed, so I wander until I I’m lost. The night is cool and sweet, so I don’t mind. I find a restaurant, a low-lit place with a handful of patrons scattered outside, and then I look up...The Acropolis looms in front of me...I suck in a breath like the tourist I am, drowning in my first Greek myths, my first sigh of fascination with the long-dead and the fictional, my love affair with fickle gods and calloused heroes...I dart down another back alley, encroaching on the territory of a passel of stray cats. They stare up at me with suspicious eyes. There’s one in the back that looks like my Orion, our cat who was struck by a car when I was in twelfth grade. He glowers up at me as I chirp at him, and he and a friend break from the ranks of their comrades, running up the alley like the devil’s at their heels...I am in love with this place...I end up at ex ΡΑΔΙΟΦΩΝΟ Bar (for the uninitiated: Radiofono — I think). It’s small and dark and there’s no light except for candles on the tables and a couple of low gleams by the bar. There’s a handful of Greeks at one table and another at the bar, and two of my countrymen kissing on the barstools and a saxophonist wailing on the speakers. I order a gin-and-tonic and make my way across the checkered floor to a seat by the crack in the wall-length mirror. I keep thinking <em>I’m in Athens </em>like there aren’t people who lead normal lives here, like this place has been conjured from my own fantasy...The song changes: <em>Dream-maker, heartbreaker, wherever you’re going, I’m going your way</em>…..The owner buys me a drink and I stay at the bar until 3:00, talking about pool and politics with him and another patron. I’m the talkative American and loving it, answering questions on Obama from one man and listening to tales of DJing in Thailand from the other. I think that I’d like to DJ in Thailand. I think that I’d like to do anything in Thailand...<em>Where are you going?</em> they ask me, and I want to say: <em>Everywhere</em>...I go home and dream of my alley cats fleeing into the foggy moon...(<a href="http://swim-parallel.blogspot.com/2009/05/alleys.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow">at the blog</a>)	26758	greece; eurotrip 2009; travel; athens; bottles; alcohol; bars; 52 stories; blog post photos; 	A man changes a light bulb in a darkened bar.

For three days, then I'm home for a day before heading to Vienna for a conference for 10 days. Max and I went to the beach in Virginia. When we got there, it was raining. But we made the most of it. Because of the weather, the wind was perfect for flying a kite! The kite is from last summer, and the cross bar was missing. So Max, rather brilliantly, found a stick and used a knife to make it fit where the cross bar would go. And it worked (as is clearly evidenced by this photo)!	2199	beach; kite; cloudy; windy; waves; silhouette; sand; storm; rain; 365; project365; project365-191; b&w; black and white; 	A person standing on top of a beach flying a kite.	person running along the beach flying a kite 	A man is flying a kite along the shore.	a guy is running at the ocean and is pulling on string to keep his kite flying.

They might also be struck by controversies that have arisen over some statues in Dublin and the disappearance of some of the city's most prominent monuments...Dublin's most prominent monument, Nelson's Pillar, which stood near the General Post Office (GPO) in the centre of O'Connell Street, was blown up by the IRA in 1966, as their way of commemorating the Easter Rising. The IRA only demolished the top of the pillar, what remained was known as the stump, until it too was blown up by the Army bomb squad for safety reasons. Ironically, this controlled explosion actually caused more damage than the original bombing...Other monuments still surviving on O'Connell Street include statues honouring Charles Stewart Parnell at the north end of the street; at the southern end stands a statue of Daniel O'Connell. Other statues on the street include one of trade union leader James Larkin...Nearby, outside St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral stand the Dublin Martyrs, Mayor Francis Taylor and his grandmother-in-law Mayoress Margaret Ball. Blessed Francis Taylor is probably the only 'blessed' politician[citation needed]. (If we define politician as one who attained elected office)...On the site of the Pillar, a new monument was erected in January 2003. Officially named the Spire of Dublin, this tall needle-like structure has already received a number of nicknames including The Spike, The Binge Syringe, The Stiletto in the Ghetto, The Nail in the Pale (see the Pale), The Pin in the Bin, The Stiffy at the Liffey, and The Erection in the Intersection. ..To erect the new monument, a notorious 1980s monument to the personified river Liffey, Anna Livia, was removed from nearby on O'Connell St. The river was represented by a woman sitting on a slope with water running down past her, bubbling. It rapidly came to be nicknamed the Floozie in the Jacuzzi, the Bitch in the Ditch, the Hoor in the Sewer ('hoor' is a dialectal Irish version of 'whore', and in a &quot;working class&quot; Dublin accent, rhymes with sewer.), Bidet Mulligan (play on the song Biddy Mulligan) and Viagra Falls.North Earl Street runs right onto the base of the Spire. At this junction is a statue of James Joyce, the world-famous Irish writer, walking with a cane in his hand. It is known to the Dublin populace as the Prick with the Stick...Just by the Ha'penny Bridge is a statue of two women sitting on a bench engaged in conversation with their shopping bags at their feet - they are known famously as the Hags with the Bags..A short distance away from O'Connell Street by the banks of the Liffey lies the site of an ill-fated millennium clock, erected in the mid-1990s to count down the hours, minutes and seconds to the year 2000. The clock, with a green-illuminated digital face, was placed underneath the surface of the river by the bank so that the time shone up through the water. A postcard booth was placed on the bridge above the clock that printed postcards for £1, each bearing the exact amount of time left at that moment until the dawn of the new millennium. However, the clock entered a period of chronic ill health: it had to be temporarily removed to allow a rowing-boat race to pass by and in the months that followed, it had repeated problems with letting in water and failing to display the time correctly. It was removed after a brief period, but not before it had been variously nicknamed the Time in the Slime, and Chime in the Slime by the people of Dublin. Also it received the nickname An Rud in the Mud (a usage of the Gaelic word 'rud', meaning 'thing' or an object of no actual function - the implication being that the clock was of no practical use, even when it worked). A rectangular hole left in the side of the bridge was later filled with an unauthorised plaque commemorating a fictitious priest, Father Pat Noise...On College Street, outside Trinity College, the traffic island that a statue to the nineteenth-century lyricist Thomas Moore shares with a public toilet has long been known as The Meeting of the Waters, thus neatly honouring both the civic facility and an eponymous work of the writer...Another statue to earn a dubious but comical nickname is a monument at the bottom of Grafton Street representing Molly Malone, a fictitious fishmonger featured in Dublin's anthem, Molly Malone, who is shown, with ample cleavage, wheeling a cart. The statue was erected to celebrate Dublin's millennium in 1988 (although Dublin was more than 1,000 years old at the time, see History of Dublin), and is generally known in Dublin as the Tart with the Cart, the Dolly with the Trolley, the Trollop with the Scollops, the Dish with the Fish or the Flirt in the Skirt...On the north-east corner of St. Stephen's Green, a semi-circle of rough stone pillars commemorating the Irish Famine and surrounding a statue of Wolfe Tone, is sometimes called Tone-henge (after Stonehenge). In Merrion Square, inside the north west corner gateway, there's a statue of Oscar Wilde composed of different coloured stone, sitting on a large granite boulder. This has been called at least once The Queer with the Leer, The Fag on the Crag or The Quare in the Square (&quot;quare&quot; being a dialectal Irish pronunciation of queer).[..On Sandymount Strand, close to the Martello Tower, you can find the sore on the shore. Traffic news on Dublin City Anna Livia radio call it the white lady.[..Curiously, given that Ireland has been independent for over eighty years, no statues in Dublin commemorate independent Irish leaders. Statues were never erected to figures like Éamon de Valera[2], W. T. Cosgrave, Seán Lemass or any of the presidents of Ireland. One of the few elected politicians commemorated with a statue is Henry Grattan, a leading politician of the 1780s in the old Irish Parliament. A nearby statue of patriot Thomas Davis has earned the nickname Frankenstein due to the out of scale hands and odd shaped body given to the nationalist leader in the 1960s work...Dublin was once famed for its high quality equestrian statues, including the Lord Gough monument in the Phoenix Park, the William of Orange statue in College Green and the King George II statue in St Stephen's Green. No statues of people on horseback remain today, as they have all since been blown up by the IRA. There is, however, a modern equestrian statue outside the &quot;Break for the Border&quot; nightclub on Stephen Street. The statues consists of an INDIAN mounted on the horse back.	34557	Infomatique; Dublin; County Dublin; Ireland; Streets Of Dublin; Dublin streets; Europe; Photographed By William Murphy; Urban; Street Photography; Urban Space; Sony; NEX-7; Public Art; Art; Statue; Sculpture; Bronze; statueinfomatique; statuesinfomatique; publicartinfomatique; 	A sculpture of two women stting on a bench with their purses on the ground while people standing in a line behind them.

The clock, cast by J.L. Mott Iron Works of Trenton, New Jersey, was also a fountain.  Water flowed from stylized dolphin heads into the lower bowls, which allowed &quot;man's best friend&quot; a drink.  The statue on top is of the Greek Goddess Hebe, daughter of Zeus and Hera, and the keeper of the exilir of eternal your for the gods of Mt. Olympus.  The selection of Hebe represented the healing properties of the City's mineral water.  ..In 1991, the Historic Preservation Commission and the Colorado Centennial Chapter #100 of the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors restored the Clock using donations from citizens and businesses.	873	Wheeler Town Clock; clock; sculpture; J.L.

There are now Kidz Kartz programmes running in Pukekohe, Cambridge, Christchurch and Southland. .Pony racing is very popular in Australia, America and Europe and we thought it was about time Kiwi kids got in on the action. .Even though it is fun for both kids and ponies it helps to develop a well rounded horse-person who is capable of driving safely and tactfully on the trotting track, and the knowledge to care for horse and pony. <a href="http://www.kidzkartz.co.nz/Site/Home.ashx" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.kidzkartz.co.nz/Site/Home.ashx</a>	1365	New Zealand; Cambridge,Waikato Region; Kemureti; Harness racing; 	A man riding a horse drawn carriage on a race track.
