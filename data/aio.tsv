Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.&quot;..My iPhone came in the mail today!  Serendipitously, I spent the afternoon on the internet researching various lists of the top iPhone apps and then when I got home, there was my new toy!..Recently I decided it was time I got myself a smartphone.  I don't really talk on my phone that much.  Mostly I use it for going on the internet, texting, and playing games, so smartphones would seem to be perfect for me.  I've been a T-Mobile customer for the past 7 years and I would've gotten a model they offered, but they decided I wasn't eligible for an upgrade discount and were going to charge me $399 for their smartphone.  Hmmm, let's see.... I could stick with T-Mobile and pay $399 for their smartphone, or I could switch to AT&amp;T and get an iPhone for $99... okay then, AT&amp;T it is!  Brilliant business model, T-Mobile...Now if I can just get the activation to kick in on my iPhone I'll be able to play around with it.  ..(August 5, 2009)..P.S. - thanks to Brian for giving me the idea for the title.	5213	iphone; apple; phone; mobile; cellular; smart; smartphone; hand; cell; Project365; 365; August 5, 2009; 	A hand holding a smart phone with apps on a screen.

The Elephant sign has been fully restored and now sits atop it's place of honor on Aurora once more..The back story on the elephant goes like this: Sometime in the 1920s or '30s, Giovanni &quot;John&quot; Braida decided to build the sculpture to keep his employees busy during the Great Depression. His idea was to create a one-of-a-kind, life-size piece to show off their craftsmanship skills...The grander the better, he said. Giovanni drew inspiration from India, which led to the making of the ceremonial elephant, complete with a howdah. Materials were scraped together from his backyard, chicken wire was stretched around a frame and reinforced with water pipes. Wet concrete was layered on top and shaped. The howdah was constructed out of wood. After completion in the mid-1930s, the elephant stood in front of Giovanni Braida's business on Woodland Park Ave. As the city streetcar made the bend at North 34th Street, riders looked out and recognized it as a landmark...In 1946, the elephant was sold to the Aurora Flower shop and moved to it's current location - and the elephant had been a roadside fixture ever since. 	1570	Canon EOS 3000V; Ilford XP2 Super 400; Film; Analog; Real photograph; canon rebel K2; 35mm; eos; Canon EOS Rebel K2; SLR; latent image; 3000V Rebel K2; Canon; K2; Tamron AF 28-200mm; 3000V; latent; image; I shoot film; ISO 400; Ilford; project; 365; project 365; November; B&W; Black; white; black and white; black & white; Aurora; highway; 99; highway 99; elephant; Aurora Flower; Aurora Rents; sign; roadside attraction; americana; roadside america; landmark; icon; Seattle; washington; cement; sculpture; vintage; seattle washington; XP2; monochrome; 2009; November 2009; washington state; state; Pacific Highway 1; SR 99; US 99; US Highway 99; Old Highway 99; Old 99; 	A large statue of an elephant is attached to a business sign.	a statue of an elephant with a box on its back 	An advertising billboard featuring the statue of an elephant with a howdah on its back.

I felt bad enough about cheating with the non-story <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/swimparallel/3497745254">last post</a> that I wrote another one the same night.</em>..When I wake up on my first night in Athens, I debate the merits of the hostel’s 11:30 bar crawl until 11:30 and come down to find out that they’ve already left. Instead I get directions to another place from the man at the front desk of my hostel. He says the area is safe; I don’t think twice. In D.C., I walk fearlessly at nights, because it’s my city and I’ve lived there for almost five years and if someone was going to mess with me, they probably would have done it by now...As soon as I step out into the darkness, reality settles: I’m a silly girl in a foreign city and I’m carrying my wallet in my hand because the only purse I have is a camera/laptop bag and I don’t want to drag that out. In other words, I’m practically wearing a “Mug Me” T-shirt over my sarong. But if I had any sense, my life would probably look a lot different, so I start walking anyway, and I take back alleys to spite my nervousness...I take a right at a kiosk and walk up my first alley. The couple on the left side of the road laughs, throws something onto the sidewalk; I hear the screech of an alley cat. There are stray cats everywhere here and I want to take all of them home. They take off on their moped and I keep walking...The bar the man sent me to is closed, so I wander until I I’m lost. The night is cool and sweet, so I don’t mind. I find a restaurant, a low-lit place with a handful of patrons scattered outside, and then I look up...The Acropolis looms in front of me...I suck in a breath like the tourist I am, drowning in my first Greek myths, my first sigh of fascination with the long-dead and the fictional, my love affair with fickle gods and calloused heroes...I dart down another back alley, encroaching on the territory of a passel of stray cats. They stare up at me with suspicious eyes. There’s one in the back that looks like my Orion, our cat who was struck by a car when I was in twelfth grade. He glowers up at me as I chirp at him, and he and a friend break from the ranks of their comrades, running up the alley like the devil’s at their heels...I am in love with this place...I end up at ex ΡΑΔΙΟΦΩΝΟ Bar (for the uninitiated: Radiofono — I think). It’s small and dark and there’s no light except for candles on the tables and a couple of low gleams by the bar. There’s a handful of Greeks at one table and another at the bar, and two of my countrymen kissing on the barstools and a saxophonist wailing on the speakers. I order a gin-and-tonic and make my way across the checkered floor to a seat by the crack in the wall-length mirror. I keep thinking <em>I’m in Athens </em>like there aren’t people who lead normal lives here, like this place has been conjured from my own fantasy...The song changes: <em>Dream-maker, heartbreaker, wherever you’re going, I’m going your way</em>…..The owner buys me a drink and I stay at the bar until 3:00, talking about pool and politics with him and another patron. I’m the talkative American and loving it, answering questions on Obama from one man and listening to tales of DJing in Thailand from the other. I think that I’d like to DJ in Thailand. I think that I’d like to do anything in Thailand...<em>Where are you going?</em> they ask me, and I want to say: <em>Everywhere</em>...I go home and dream of my alley cats fleeing into the foggy moon...(<a href="http://swim-parallel.blogspot.com/2009/05/alleys.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow">at the blog</a>)	26816	greece; eurotrip 2009; travel; athens; bottles; alcohol; bars; 52 stories; blog post photos; 	A man changes a light bulb in a darkened bar.

This building is not yet occupied. The interior spaces are wired and mostly finished, but there was still a lot of exposed concrete and insulation. It was very much the anti-Free Sheep -- up-and-coming rather than condemned. The first two floors were filled with paintings, sculptures, installations, and video art that were somewhat compelling, but the installation on the third floor was the best piece we've seen in Miami thus far. The installation took over a mostly finished condo in the building in its entirety. Some rooms were viewable through plexiglass or peepholes in false walls installed in the home, while others were intended to be walked through. The first floor had a meth lab set up in the kitchen, and the upper floor offered surveillance of the lower floor, along with a refrigerator that had a false back, through which was a room that was completely charred on the interior, another room had holes in the wall with tape recorders exposed, another room contained dozens of mason jars with various detritus, and it ended with a view of Miami from the condo's balcony. On the way out we bumped into an Olsen twin. We think it was Mary-Kate because she was wearing so many clothes.	600	abmb 2008; artbasel miamibeach 2008; 	A room with an empty and open refrigerator and a shelf of bottles.

The festival honoured Athena, the city's patron deity. The vase would have been one of 140, each containing 40 litres of olive oil, given to the winner...Chariot racing was the most popular spectator sport in ancient times. Up to 40 chariots could compete in a race and crashes were common. The two turning posts at either end of the oblong course were the most dangerous parts of the track...The painter of this vase has been highly successful in creating the illusion of speed as the chariot careers along. A quadriga chariot drawn by four horses is shown, the hair and tunic of the charioteer are blown back, and the manes and tails of the horses fly in the rush of air. The chariot is coming up to a post which may represent the turn or the finish of the race. Both moments would be climaxes...While the sport for which the prize was given was shown on one side of these vessels, Athena herself was usually shown on the other side. On this one she wears a high-crested helmet, an elaborately decorated chiton (tunic), and her characteristic aegis, a snake-fringed poncho worn around her neck...Source: <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/c/chariot_race_prize_amphora.aspx" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_object...</a>	2794		A Egyptian painting with 4 black horses on it	Four black horses being driven across the sky on this ancient vase.

Popular legend has it that while one giant bird looks out over the city to protect its people, the other bird looks out to sea at the new sailors coming in to port. Alternatively, local legend states one Liver Bird is male, looking inland to see if the pubs are open, whilst the other is female, looking out to sea to see if there are any handsome sailors coming up the river. Yet another local legend, reflecting Liverpudlians' famous sense of humour, avers that every time a virgin walks across Pier Head, the Liver Birds flap their wings. It is also said that, if one of the birds were to fly away the city of Liverpool would cease to exist, thus adding to the mystery of the birds.

We then stopped at my parents house for presents and Christmas brunch. ..It was so funny seeing my Mum and Dad both open their presents as they had both bought each other a Kindle and didn't have a clue they were getting one themselves! We were all laughing our heads off by the time they had realised!..In the afternoon we headed off to my uncle Alecs for a big family Christmas dinner. I love Christmas with the family - there are usually about 20 of us there and it is always a great day of eating and drinking...After the dinner someone brought out the Christmas Pudding. My Dad, who had already prefessed earlier on in the day whilst lighting the fire at home, that he was an expert at starting fires, then proceeded to drench it in Whisky and try to set it on fire. The first attempt wasn't successful so I suggested he heat up the Whisky first. This is when he decided to put it in a spoon and 'cook' it over a candle. Well, that worked a treat and the Christmas pudding was successfully set on fire much to every ones delight. In fact it went down so well that they then went on to set fire to the other two desserts we had!	996	365; 140/365; 365project; project365; christmas; christmas day; fire; flame; flambe; pudding; cake; chocolate; fruit; family; 	A man and woman standing over a dinner table with a cake.

Well, not early for a work day, but very early for a day off. We are having a very mini (one night) break up to the Lakes today so wanted to set off nice and early so we could get there are a reasonable time to go for a walk. As I feared it was chucking it down when we set off and the rain got heavier and heavier the further north we got. It wasn't looking good. However, when we got about half an hour away the rain started to lighten and we even spotted a bit of blue sky in the distance. We arrived at the hotel just before lunch and although it was grey, it had stopped raining :) We dropped our stuff off at the hotel, had a bit of tea and cake and then headed off for a walk. We decided just to do a short one so went around a lake called Lowes Water. Even though it was a grey day it was still very beautiful with the tops of the hills disappearing into the clouds. We met these little cows at the start of the walk - so cute! This is why I am a vegetarian, I couldn't possibly eat something so adorable!	739	365; cow; lake district; 365project; project365; b&w; blackandwhite; monochrome; nature; wildlife; 	a cow staring into a camera standing on a field 	Here is a image of an zoo animals.

If you <a href="http://www.jeffhester.net/2011/02/07/fitness-challenge-2/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">read my blog</a> (who doesn't?!), you know that I started a 5-week fit challenge last week. The first four days I went through detoxification, eating soup three times a day, along with brown rice, chicken breast, oatmeal and whey protein powder for breakfast. I made it, but I could never live on that. ..Saturday was (as Tim Ferriss calls it) my &quot;Dieter's Gone Wild&quot; day. A free day. I ate and drank plenty. Sunday I began Ferriss' Slow Carb diet. No fruit and no &quot;white&quot; carbs (flour, rice and similar products). Basically it's protein, vegetables and legumes at every meal. ..That was a long winded explanation for this photo. Beginning in the top left and going counter-clockwise, this is today's breakfast, lunch and dinner. ..Breakfast was egg whites (with a couple spoons of salsa), lentils and spinach. Lunch was comprised of fresh baby spinach and arugula, lentils, a can of all white tuna, drizzled with a little Trader Joe's fat-free basalmic vinaigrette.  And for dinner, black beans, grilled chicken breast, and broccoli florets...And I've dropped 4 lbs since last Monday! 	2309	4 hour body; breakfast; dinner; food; food porn; lunch; project365; slow carb diet; 	Pictures of different types of prepared food containing beans.

Produced by North American Aviation, the Sabre is best known as America's first swept wing fighter which could counter the similarly-winged Soviet MiG-15 in high speed dogfights over the skies of the Korean War. Considered one of the best and most important fighter aircraft in the Korean War, the F-86 is also rated highly in comparison with fighters of other eras. Although it was developed in the late 1940s and was outdated by the end of the 1950s, the Sabre proved versatile and adaptable, and continued as a front-line fighter in numerous air forces until the last active operational examples were retired by the Bolivian Air Force in 1994. The F-86L was an upgrade conversion of the F-86D with new electronics, extended wingtips and wing leading edges, revised cockpit layout, and uprated engine; 981 were converted. .Source: Wikipedia..This plane is located at the entrance to the Bert Mooney Airport in Butte, Montana (corner of Harrison Avenue and Airport Road). 	3289	Butte, Montana; Silver Bow County; Harrison Avenue; USAF; F-86; F-86L; Sabre Dog; Bert Mooney Airport; North American Aviation; under10views; nopeople; object; airplane; Aviation; animal; Aircraft; military; fav; 2fav; outdoor; transport; transportation; 	a jet on three pillars in front of a building	A fighter jet sitting on top of a set of three cement blocks.

For three days, then I'm home for a day before heading to Vienna for a conference for 10 days. Max and I went to the beach in Virginia. When we got there, it was raining. But we made the most of it. Because of the weather, the wind was perfect for flying a kite! The kite is from last summer, and the cross bar was missing. So Max, rather brilliantly, found a stick and used a knife to make it fit where the cross bar would go. And it worked (as is clearly evidenced by this photo)!	2207	beach; kite; cloudy; windy; waves; silhouette; sand; storm; rain; 365; project365; project365-191; b&w; black and white; 	A person standing on top of a beach flying a kite.	person running along the beach flying a kite 	A man is flying a kite along the shore.	a guy is running at the ocean and is pulling on string to keep his kite flying.

Although obsolete by some standards, it proved to be a formidable weapon in the Coral Sea, and the battle for the solomons.  The Dauntless and its brave aircrews are best remembered for sinking all four of the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway, earning the nickname &quot;Slow But Deadly.&quot;  Large dive brakes were built into the trailing edge of the wing.  They were opened for speed control during the near vertical descent towards a target.  When the bomb was dropped, the underbelly Y shaped &quot;trapeze&quot; pivotd forward and down to guide the ordinance past the popeller arc...The SBD-3 Dauntless were equipped with 1,000 horsepower Wright R1820-52 Cyclone 9 cylinder engines.  With a wingspan of 41 feet, 6 inches and a length of 32 feet, 8 inches, they weighed 10,4000 pounds loaded.  They could reach speeds of 250mph and ranged over 1,200 miles.  5,936 of these dive bombers were built by the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force between 1940 and when production ended in July 1944...This aircraft is displayed in the markings of the Dauntless dive bomber that Lt. Richard Best and Aviation Chief Radio man J.F. Murray flew during the attack ont he Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi on June 4, 1942.  Best, a 1932 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy was the commanding officer of Bombing Squadron Six (VB-6) aboard the U.S. carrier Enterprise.  Mid-morning on June 4, Best and two wingmen aborted an attack on the already targeted carrier Kaga, turning instead to attack the nearby carrier Akagi.  While his wingman scored near misses, best placed his 1,000 lb. bomb in the center of the flight deck, dooming the akagi.  Later that afternoon, Lt. Best led his squadron against the carrier Hiryu, which was hit by four 1,000 lb. bombs and blew up in dramatic fashion.  Richard Best never flew again.  His oxygen supply malfunctioned affecting his lungs.   ..The Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor (PAM), located on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor, opened to the public on December 7, 2006.  The first phase of the museum is Hanger 37, a 42,442-square foot former seaplane hangar that survived the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, features a 200-seat theater and a 25,000-square foot exhibit area, which highlights the story of military aviation in the Pacific during World War II.

It was the first building to be rebuilt with a World Trade Center address and was not included in the original World Trade Center master plan by Daniel Libeskind...The 52-story building, designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in conjunction with glass designer/artist James Carpenter, is is 750 feet tall, and contains 1,700,000 square feet of leasable office space starting from the 11th floor.  The first ten floors are devoted to an electrical substation which powers most of Lower Manhattan. They used ultra-clear, low-iron glass to provide reflectivity and light, with stainless-steel spandrels behind the glass that also help reflect sunlight...Artist Jenny Holzer created a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2238549089/">large light installation inside the main lobby</a> with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels. The entire wall is about 30 meters wide by 7 meters tall and changes colors, according to the time of day...The building is considered New York City's first &quot;green&quot; office tower by gaining gold status in the US Green Building Council's LEED program. Rainwater is collected and used for irrigation of a triangular park, and to cool the building.  Recycled steel was used in the building's construction...The park outside was created by David Childs with Ken Smith and his colleague Annie Weinmayr of Ken Smith Landscape Architect.  It consists simply of an open plaza with a fountain and groves of trees.  The fountain features Jeff Koons's mirror-polished stainless steel sculpture, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2238403119/">Balloon Flower (Red)</a>, which represents a twisted balloon in the shape of a flower.	3966	NYC; New York City; World Trade Center; WTC; 7 World Trade Center; downtown; skyscraper; Manhattan; Financial District; modern; postmodern; pomo; gothamist; David Childs; SOM; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; skidmore, owings and merrill; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP; ny; New York; 7 wtc; James Carpenter; silverstein properties; fidi; one way; street sign; greenwich street; 	A city street corner with a street pole that has one way signs and a light on the top, and a building in the background.

It was given in 1967 by the RATP (Régie autonome des transports parisiens) to commemorate the collaboration of French and Canadian engineers in building the Montréal Métro.   ..Square-Victoria is a station on the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro rapid transit system, operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM).  It was inaugurated on February 6, 1967..Square Victoria (Victoria Square) was built on the empty space at the intersection of Cote du Beaver Hall (Beaver Hall Hill) and McGill Street in 1813.  Formerly known as Place du Marché-à-Foin and Place des Commissaires, it was renamed for Queen Victoria for the visit of the then-Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1860.  Victoria Square has undergone many aesthetic changes over its history, functioning at times more as a parking lot, other times as a simple open space, while at others being far more refined and cultivated. The Square was restored to its current configuration in 2002 and 2003. It features <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/3819671011">a statue of Queen Victoria</a>, and trees lining its bounding avenues.	2143	Bouche de métro Guimard; Guimard; hector guimard; art nouveau; sign; Montréal metro; Montreal metro; metro; Société de transport de Montréal; Societe de transport de Montreal; STM; Montréal; Montreal; Quartier international de Montréal; Quartier international; QIM; International District; Ville Marie; Québec; Quebec; Square Victoria; Victoria Square; canada; Quartier international de Montreal; 	There is a map in the street of the city.	a bus stop map in a city near a water fountain	The subway stop Square Victoria entrance and the map of the neighborhood	A map and street sign with building in background.

Construction on what was to become a $276 million U.S. General Services Commission building was halted immediately, and a subsequent archeological investigation unearthed the remnants of a five- to six-acre African burial ground used throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.  Initially, the federal government resisted permanent discontinuation.  owever, the overwhelming response from the African-American community, including then Mayor David Dinkins, in the form of protests, vigils, public meetings, and religious observances eventually won the support of the federal government...Enslaved Africans began arriving on the shores of the colony of New Amsterdam as early as 1626, and the area known today as New York City was one of the largest slave trading centers (second only to Charleston, South Carolina) throughout the colonial period.  The Burial Ground, though, wasn't created until the early 1700s, when Trinity Church banned all Africans from its cemetery, leaving them relegated to a deserted area, then more than a mile outside the city limit, to bury their dead.  As the city began to expand throughout the 18th century, it appropriated the space occupied by the African Burial Ground and covered the site with landfill and debris from the nearby leather and pottery industries. By the time slavery was abolished in New York -- on Emancipation Day, July 4, 1827 -- many had long forgotten about the burial ground. ..At the time of its discovery in 1991, the African Burial Ground was recognized as the largest and only known urban pre-Revolutionary African cemetery in the country. In 1993, the federal government declared the site a National Historic Landmark. Between the time of  its discovery and its designation as a historic landmark, urban archeologists exhumed the remains of more than 400 African adults and children, along with various artifacts such as beads, coins, and shells, and transported them to Washington, D.C.'s Howard University...In September 2005, ground was broken for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/2253673829/">$3 million memorial</a>, located at Duane and Elk Streets, commemorating the lives of 20,000 enslaved Africans who were laid to rest in the Civic Center area in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Though most remains were exhumed, more than 400 were ceremoniously reinterred in October 2003...National Historic Register #93001597	3349	african burial ground way; street sign; sign; duane street; elk street; paul o'dwyer way; african burial ground; african burial ground national monument; african burial ground memorial; memorial; new york city; new york; nyc; ny; civic center; manhattan; gothamist; downtown; national historic site; national monument; National Park Service; NPS; National Register of Historic Places; NRHP; U.S. National Register of Historic Places; National Historic Landmark; NHL; landmark; U.S. National Historic Landmark; 	A street sign showing four different roads on it	A pole with multiple street signs in front of a tall building.	a close up of street signs with buildings in the background	a polewith many street signs standing in front of a very tall building	Street corner sign in a big city with multiple names	40.71459	-74.004018	United States	./database/coco_tag/374727.png		NULL	./database/coco_stuff/374727.png	building-other; metal; sky-other; skyscraper;

On the desk is one of two  busts in the room dating from the 1930s by African-American sculptor Richmond Barthe--this one a portrait of a young Edgar Kaufmann Jr.  The glass Savoy Vase on the desk was designed by Alvar Aalto in 1936.  Featured in Edgar Kaufmann Jr.'s book <i>What is Modern Design?</i> is one of Aalto's most famous designs.  It is named after the Helsinki restaurant where Aalto, with his wife, Aino Marsio Aalto, designed the interior and furnishings, and placed one of the vases on every table.  The Aaltos were guests of Mrs. Kaufmann at Fallingwater in 1939...Fallingwater, sometimes referred to as the Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr. Residence or just the Kaufmann Residence, located within a 5,100-acre nature reserve 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built between 1936 and 1939.   Built over a 30-foot flowing waterfall on Bear Run in the Mill Run section of Stewart Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, the house served as a vacation retreat for the Kaufmann family including patriarch, Edgar Kaufmann Sr., was a successful Pittsburgh businessman and president of Kaufmann's Department Store, and his son, Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., who studied architecture briefly under Wright.  Wright collaborated with staff engineers Mendel Glickman and William Wesley Peters on the structural design, and assigned his apprentice, Robert Mosher, as his permanent on-site representative throughout construction.    Despite frequent conflicts between Wright, Kaufmann, and the construction contractor, the home and guesthouse were finally constructed at a cost of $155,000.  ..Fallingwater was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.  It was listed among the Smithsonian's 28 Places to See Before You Die.  In a 1991 poll of members of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), it was voted &quot;the best all-time work of American architecture.&quot;  In 2007, Fallingwater was ranked #29 on the AIA 150 America's Favorite Architecture list...National Register #74001781 (1974)	4758	bust; sculpture; flowers; vase; desk; dressing room; edgar kaufmann sr's study; bedroom; edgar kaufmann sr's bedroom; Fallingwater; Kaufmann Residence; Edgar J.

The clock, cast by J.L. Mott Iron Works of Trenton, New Jersey, was also a fountain.  Water flowed from stylized dolphin heads into the lower bowls, which allowed &quot;man's best friend&quot; a drink.  The statue on top is of the Greek Goddess Hebe, daughter of Zeus and Hera, and the keeper of the exilir of eternal your for the gods of Mt. Olympus.  The selection of Hebe represented the healing properties of the City's mineral water.  ..In 1991, the Historic Preservation Commission and the Colorado Centennial Chapter #100 of the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors restored the Clock using donations from citizens and businesses.	877	Wheeler Town Clock; clock; sculpture; J.L.

The 75.5-meter tall Palladian-style clock tower was a gift from the local British community to the city in commemoration of the centennial of the May Revolution of 1810.  Four clocks, designed in imitation of the ones at Westminster Abbey, sit at the 35-meter level.  The tower is topped by an octagonal copper roofed cupola...The clock tower was renamed Torre Monumental following the Islas Malvinas/Falkland Islands War.  Monumento a los Caídos en Malvinas (Islas Malvinas-Falkland Islands War Memorial) was placed deliberately across the street, paying tribute to the Argentine casualties, with names etched in black marble, suffered at the hands of the British in the 1982 war.	1018	Torre Monumental; Torre do los Ingleses; Tower of the British; British Tower; clock tower; torre de reloj; Sir Ambrose Macdonald Poytner; Plaza Fuerza Aérea Argentina; Plaza Fuerza Aerea Argentina; Plaza Británica; Plaza Britanica; Buenos Aires; Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires; South America; Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires; Englishmen’s Tower; Monumental Tower; Plaza Britannia; Britain Plaza; Palladian; Retiro; Argentina; night; 	there is a very tall tower with a clock at the top	View from the base of a large ornate clock tower.

Marlene Marie Williams(1940 - 2009) .Marlene was born on August 13, 1940 in Oakland, California and passed away on June 22, 2009, in San Luis Obispo, California. Marlene graduated from Fremont High School in Oakland, California and earned her B.S. in Nursing from San Francisco State in 1963. At San Francisco State, she met Rod and they were married on September 10, 1966. She moved to Bakersfield, California where she and Rod had two children: Mike and Julie. In Bakersfield, she worked as a public health nurse for the Kern County Health Department, the Lakeside Unified School District, and the Superintendent of Schools Migrant Program. In 1989, Marlene and Rod moved to Morro Bay, California where she worked for the San Luis Obispo County Health Department until 2004 when she retired. Over her entire life, Marlene participated in her community in a variety of different ways. While living in Bakersfield, she was an active member of Junior League. In Morro Bay, she was very involved with her church and regularly attended St. Timothy's Catholic Church in Morro Bay, California. Marlene's passion for life, her smile and her positive attitude were contagious to everyone she met. Above all else, Marlene loved spending time with her family and friends and these relationships were more meaningful to her than anything else. Whether it was traveling the world with Rod, hosting family gatherings, talking with her children, taking care of her grandchildren in Moscow and San Diego, spending time with her friends walking her dog Mandee at Cloister's Park, or visiting with family and the &quot;Golden Girls,&quot; in the Bay Area, Marlene' generous, selfless, and kind spirit was ever present and constant. As a wife, a mother, a grandmother, a sister, an aunt, and as a friend, she will be deeply missed. She is survived by her husband, Rod Williams; her son, Mike Williams, and wife Molly; her daughter, Julie Michaels, and husband Eric; her brother, Manuel Martin, and wife Karen; her nephew, Steve Martin, and wife Tara; her niece, Deanna Martin; and five grandchildren. The family would like to give special thanks to Drs. Koch and Schultz as well as the nurses at Sierra Vista Hospital in San Luis Obispo. They also thank Dr. William Baker and his staff in Bakersfield for their many years of support to Marlene. A public viewing and rosary will be held from 5:00-7:00 p.m., on Friday, June 26, at St. Timothy's Catholic Church in Morro Bay. A mass will be held 10:00-11:30 a.m. on Saturday, June 27 at St. Timothy's Catholic Church, which will be followed by a reception. A brief graveside service will be held at Old Mission Cemetery in San Luis Obispo at 3:00 p.m. Arrangements are being handled by Benedict Rettey Mortuary and Crematory.

Their height enables them to reach juicy acacia and myrrh leaves that are too high for other browsing wildlife such as antelope and elephants. They also have a modified upper neck joint, allowing them to stretch their head upwards, and a tough 45cm (17.6in) tongue for tackling the thorniest of high branches. When stretching down to eat and drink, giraffes have a special valve that prevents their blood rushing to their brain...Although giraffes have adapted to coping with the thorns of the Acacia tree, this tough plant has developed other ways to make it harder for browsing animals to enjoy its leaves and shoots and reduce its losses. Some species have hollow thorns that are colonised by ants, which attack any animal looking for a tasty meal. Acacias also warn each other to prepare for an attack by producing bitter chemicals.	1909	Infomatique; Dublin; Ireland; Zoo; Dublin Zoo; Streets Of Dublin; Europe; Sony; NEX-7; Photographed By William Murphy; Phoenix Park; Sony NEX-7; parksandgardensinfomatique; 	A group of giraffe standing next to each other.

They might also be struck by controversies that have arisen over some statues in Dublin and the disappearance of some of the city's most prominent monuments...Dublin's most prominent monument, Nelson's Pillar, which stood near the General Post Office (GPO) in the centre of O'Connell Street, was blown up by the IRA in 1966, as their way of commemorating the Easter Rising. The IRA only demolished the top of the pillar, what remained was known as the stump, until it too was blown up by the Army bomb squad for safety reasons. Ironically, this controlled explosion actually caused more damage than the original bombing...Other monuments still surviving on O'Connell Street include statues honouring Charles Stewart Parnell at the north end of the street; at the southern end stands a statue of Daniel O'Connell. Other statues on the street include one of trade union leader James Larkin...Nearby, outside St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral stand the Dublin Martyrs, Mayor Francis Taylor and his grandmother-in-law Mayoress Margaret Ball. Blessed Francis Taylor is probably the only 'blessed' politician[citation needed]. (If we define politician as one who attained elected office)...On the site of the Pillar, a new monument was erected in January 2003. Officially named the Spire of Dublin, this tall needle-like structure has already received a number of nicknames including The Spike, The Binge Syringe, The Stiletto in the Ghetto, The Nail in the Pale (see the Pale), The Pin in the Bin, The Stiffy at the Liffey, and The Erection in the Intersection. ..To erect the new monument, a notorious 1980s monument to the personified river Liffey, Anna Livia, was removed from nearby on O'Connell St. The river was represented by a woman sitting on a slope with water running down past her, bubbling. It rapidly came to be nicknamed the Floozie in the Jacuzzi, the Bitch in the Ditch, the Hoor in the Sewer ('hoor' is a dialectal Irish version of 'whore', and in a &quot;working class&quot; Dublin accent, rhymes with sewer.), Bidet Mulligan (play on the song Biddy Mulligan) and Viagra Falls.North Earl Street runs right onto the base of the Spire. At this junction is a statue of James Joyce, the world-famous Irish writer, walking with a cane in his hand. It is known to the Dublin populace as the Prick with the Stick...Just by the Ha'penny Bridge is a statue of two women sitting on a bench engaged in conversation with their shopping bags at their feet - they are known famously as the Hags with the Bags..A short distance away from O'Connell Street by the banks of the Liffey lies the site of an ill-fated millennium clock, erected in the mid-1990s to count down the hours, minutes and seconds to the year 2000. The clock, with a green-illuminated digital face, was placed underneath the surface of the river by the bank so that the time shone up through the water. A postcard booth was placed on the bridge above the clock that printed postcards for £1, each bearing the exact amount of time left at that moment until the dawn of the new millennium. However, the clock entered a period of chronic ill health: it had to be temporarily removed to allow a rowing-boat race to pass by and in the months that followed, it had repeated problems with letting in water and failing to display the time correctly. It was removed after a brief period, but not before it had been variously nicknamed the Time in the Slime, and Chime in the Slime by the people of Dublin. Also it received the nickname An Rud in the Mud (a usage of the Gaelic word 'rud', meaning 'thing' or an object of no actual function - the implication being that the clock was of no practical use, even when it worked). A rectangular hole left in the side of the bridge was later filled with an unauthorised plaque commemorating a fictitious priest, Father Pat Noise...On College Street, outside Trinity College, the traffic island that a statue to the nineteenth-century lyricist Thomas Moore shares with a public toilet has long been known as The Meeting of the Waters, thus neatly honouring both the civic facility and an eponymous work of the writer...Another statue to earn a dubious but comical nickname is a monument at the bottom of Grafton Street representing Molly Malone, a fictitious fishmonger featured in Dublin's anthem, Molly Malone, who is shown, with ample cleavage, wheeling a cart. The statue was erected to celebrate Dublin's millennium in 1988 (although Dublin was more than 1,000 years old at the time, see History of Dublin), and is generally known in Dublin as the Tart with the Cart, the Dolly with the Trolley, the Trollop with the Scollops, the Dish with the Fish or the Flirt in the Skirt...On the north-east corner of St. Stephen's Green, a semi-circle of rough stone pillars commemorating the Irish Famine and surrounding a statue of Wolfe Tone, is sometimes called Tone-henge (after Stonehenge). In Merrion Square, inside the north west corner gateway, there's a statue of Oscar Wilde composed of different coloured stone, sitting on a large granite boulder. This has been called at least once The Queer with the Leer, The Fag on the Crag or The Quare in the Square (&quot;quare&quot; being a dialectal Irish pronunciation of queer).[..On Sandymount Strand, close to the Martello Tower, you can find the sore on the shore. Traffic news on Dublin City Anna Livia radio call it the white lady.[..Curiously, given that Ireland has been independent for over eighty years, no statues in Dublin commemorate independent Irish leaders. Statues were never erected to figures like Éamon de Valera[2], W. T. Cosgrave, Seán Lemass or any of the presidents of Ireland. One of the few elected politicians commemorated with a statue is Henry Grattan, a leading politician of the 1780s in the old Irish Parliament. A nearby statue of patriot Thomas Davis has earned the nickname Frankenstein due to the out of scale hands and odd shaped body given to the nationalist leader in the 1960s work...Dublin was once famed for its high quality equestrian statues, including the Lord Gough monument in the Phoenix Park, the William of Orange statue in College Green and the King George II statue in St Stephen's Green. No statues of people on horseback remain today, as they have all since been blown up by the IRA. There is, however, a modern equestrian statue outside the &quot;Break for the Border&quot; nightclub on Stephen Street. The statues consists of an INDIAN mounted on the horse back.	34630	Infomatique; Dublin; County Dublin; Ireland; Streets Of Dublin; Dublin streets; Europe; Photographed By William Murphy; Urban; Street Photography; Urban Space; Sony; NEX-7; Public Art; Art; Statue; Sculpture; Bronze; statueinfomatique; statuesinfomatique; publicartinfomatique; 	A sculpture of two women stting on a bench with their purses on the ground while people standing in a line behind them.

It has both historical and contemporary economic importance. Approximatively two-thirds of the Republic of Ireland's port traffic goes via Dublin Port. Recently, the port and its land, mostly at the eastern end of Dublin's Northside, were valued at €25 billion - €30 billion...The modern Dublin Port is located either side of the River Liffey, out to its mouth. On the north side of the river, the main part (205 hectares or 510 acres) of the port lies at the end of East Wall and North Wall, from Alexandra Quay. The element of the port on the south side of the river is much smaller (51 hectares or 130 acres) and lies at the beginning of the Pigeon House peninsula...The medieval port of Dublin was located on the south bank of the Liffey near Christ Church Cathedral, some kilometers upstream from its current location. In 1715, the Great South Wall was constructed to shelter the entrance to the port. Poolbeg Lighthouse at the end of the South Bull Wall was constructed in 1767...In 1800, a survey of Dublin Bay conducted by Captain William Bligh recommended the construction of the Bull Wall. After the completion of the wall in 1842, North Bull Island slowly formed as sand built up behind it..After James Gandon's Custom House was built further downstream in 1791, the port moved downstream to the north bank of the river estuary, where the International Financial Services Centre is currently located. The noise and dirt associated with the port traffic contributed to the decline of the Mountjoy Square area, with many wealthy families moving to the Southside...With the advent of containerisation in the second half of the 20th century, the port moved about a kilometer downstream again, to its current locations...Proposals have been raised about moving the port to the new Port of Drogheda facility proposed for Bremore in north County Dublin near Balbriggan...Over many years, the Dublin Port authorities have been exploring a controversial proposal to in-fill 21 hectares (52 acres) of Dublin Bay - a continuation of historical practice, as all of the port land was once part of Dublin Bay anyway. Residents on areas near the proposed in-fill, on the north side of the Liffey, are strongly opposed to the plan.	6095	Infomatique; Dublin; Ireland; Port; Ships; Boats; Liffey; Europe; Maritime; Docklands; William Murphy; Streets Of Dublin; Dublin Streets; Irish Republic; Sony; NEX-7; 	a man walks along his bicycle near the ocean	A person walking a bilk along a road towards a light house.

It is an old area, centred around an old village, and is referenced back to 570 AD (Mervyn Archdall) but after years of light settlement, with a main village and a coastal hamlet, grew rapidly in the 20th century, and is now a mid-density Northside suburb with a village core...At the heart of Raheny lie the remains of a large ancient ringfort (or rath) from which the area gets its name. The rath extends under the centre of the modern village, from beside the Santry River, including some marshy ground, to the Roman Catholic church, Windsor Motors, the Scout Den and the two St. Assam's Churches. Some excavations were carried out in the 1970s, giving an idea of its size (probably c. 110m across) and structure. The old church and graveyard complex behind the village plaza may reflect a remnant of the rath, as does some embankment behind the scout den.	644	Infomatique; Dublin; Ireland; Raheny; Streets Of Dublin; Europe; 	A large cock sitting in the middle of a street.

And why couldn't they have kept the &quot;El Toro&quot; bull, perhaps as the outline of the sign? I'm all for upgrades but they've completely sanitized the quirky, local whimsy out of their image...I loved seeing the contrast, nonetheless, and what it says about our ideas of modernity and the price of progress.	6051	vintage; neon; signs; mexican; restaurant; bull; pig; toro; oklahoma; change; muskogee; 	A worn and a new sign for the same Mexican food restaurant.

The pretty Canal Grande marks the northern end of the harbour...Trieste is a city and seaport in northeastern Italy. It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of land lying between the Adriatic Sea and Italy's border with Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south and east of the city. Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Germanic, Latin and Slavic cultures. In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000 and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trieste province...Trieste was one of the oldest parts of the Habsburg Monarchy from 1382 until 1918. In the 19th century, it was the most important port of one of the Great Powers of Europe. As a prosperous seaport in the Mediterranean region, Trieste became the fourth largest city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (after Vienna, Budapest, and Prague). In the fin-de-siecle period, it emerged as an important hub for literature and music. However, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Trieste's union to Italy after World War I led to some decline of its &quot;Mittel-European&quot; cultural and commercial importance. Enjoying an economic revival during the 1930s and throughout the Cold War, Trieste was an important spot in the struggle between the Eastern and Western blocs. Today, the city is in one of the richest regions of Italy, and has been a great centre for shipping, through its port (Port of Trieste), shipbuilding and financial services...For further information on this fascinating city please visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste" rel="noreferrer nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste</a>	22335	Trieste; Grand Canal Trieste; Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trieste province; Habsburg Monarchy; Austro-Hungarian Empire; Boats; Buildings; Italy; Church; Canal Grande; Empress Maria Theresa; Harbour; TheGALAXY; SuperShot; COTH; Sunrays+5; BEJ*; ImpressedBeauty; FlickrsTrueReflection_1; FlickrsTrueReflection_2; my_gear_and_me; MagicMomentsInYourLifelevel1; PanoramaFotográfico; MagicMomentsInYourLifelevel2; mfcc; cloudy; day; 	Many boats are parked in the middle of a city. 	a couple of buildings surrounding a pond with boats	River down the middle of a city with many parked boats.

This is the last of that series and he hit the pitch that came well over the left center field wall for a home run. He was taken out in the 8th inning and signed perhaps around 1,000 autographs, one which was mine.

So increasingly takes on a greater role in the mobility of many cities around the world...The city of <b>Stockholm</b>, with 1.5 million inhabitants including peripherals, and Sweden as a whole have developed quite a culture cyclist, both in a sporting sense as a means of transportation replacement car...     In the capital there are approximately 350 kilometers of bicycle paths that use of 25,000 to 30,000 persons per day from April to September. This low figure in a cold city like this to 7,500 between October and March. The terrain presents no great unevenness, but neither is entirely flat...     The Department for Transport there is a department exclusively designed for planning and maintenance of everything that has to do with cycling. The first plan in this regard dates back to 1978, which outlined the broad outlines of a trace routes for cyclists and the construction of parking lots.The growing development of cycling in 1998 found that approval of a new plan which envisaged the construction of new roads to encourage cycling...From 2001 to 2006 the number of cyclists has increased from approximately 30,000 to 100,000 and the prospects are that this figure continues to rise. ..Two major factors have driven in Sweden, particularly in the capital, the promotion of cycling: the collective health and environmental preservation. The Stockholm air is much cleaner and its inhabitants completely satisfied......La bicicleta es un medio de transporte limpio, rápido, barato y sostenible. Por eso cada vez adquiere un papel más importante en la movilidad de muchas ciudades del mundo..La ciudad de <b>Estocolmo</b>, con 1,5 millones de habitantes incluida la perifera, y Suecia en su totalidad tienen una cultura ciclista bastante desarrollada, tanto en un sentido deportivo como medio de transporte sustitutivo del automóvil...    En la capital existen aproximadamente 350 kilómetros de vías para bicicletas que utilizan de 25.000 a 30.000 personas por día entre los meses de abril a septiembre. Esta cifra baja en una ciudad fría como ésta a 7.500 entre los meses de octubre a marzo. El terreno no presenta grandes desniveles, pero tampoco es plano del todo...    En la Dirección General de Tráfico existe un departamento exclusivamente destinado a la planificación y mantenimiento de todo lo que tiene que ver con el uso de la bicicleta. El primer plan en tal sentido data de 1978, en el que se esbozaron las líneas generales de un trazado de vías para ciclistas y la construcción de aparcamientos. El desarrollo creciente del uso de la bicicleta determinó que en 1998 se aprobara un nuevo plan que preveía la construcción de nuevas vías para estimular el uso de la bicicleta...Desde el 2001 hasta el 2006 el número de ciclistas aumentó aproximadamente desde 30.000 hasta 100.000 y las perspectivas son de que esa cifra continúe en aumento. La ciudad dispone de unos 350 kilómetros destinados a la circulación de bicicletas, incluyendo los aledaños donde viven 1,5 millones de habitantes...Dos motivos principales han impulsado en Suecia, y particularmente en la capital, el fomento del uso de la bicicleta: la salud colectiva y la preservación del medio ambiente. El aire de Estocolmo está mucho más limpio y sus habitantes totalmente satisfechos.	10376	Sony; DSC; H9; Europa; Europe; Suecia; Sweden; Estocolmo; Stockholm; color; bike; bicicleta; cycling; ciclismo; ciudad; city; street; calle; TheUnforgettablePictures; DragonGoldAward; Image Quality; ThePerfectPhotographer; GoldStarAward; FlickrLovers; OvertheExcellence; APlusPhoto; Claudio.Ar; Claudio Mufarrege; 	a person riding on a bicycle on the street in front of some cars	The cars are travelling behind the guy on the bicycle	a woman rides a bike in front of some cars 	A woman on a bike rides on the street in front of cars.

Side is a resort town on the southern coast of Turkey, near the villages of Manavgat and Selimiye, 75 km from Antalya) in the province of Antalya. It is located on the eastern part of the Pamphylian coast, which lies about 20 km east of the mouth of the Eurymedon River..Settlers from Cyme (Cumæans) in Aeolis, an ancient region of northwestern Asia Minor, founded the city in the seventh century BC. Possessing a good harbor for small-craft boats, Side's natural geography made it the most important place in Pamphylia – the region in the south of Asia Minor between Lycia and Cilicia, from the Mediterranean to Mount Taurus. This location made Side one of the most important trade centers in its time. Today, as in yesteryear, the ancient city of Side is situated on a small north-south peninsula about 1 km long and 400 m across..Strabo and Arrianos both record that Side was settled from Cyme (Aeolis), city in Aeolia, a region of western Anatolia. Most probably, this colonization occurred in the seventh century B.C.. According to Arrianos, when settlers from Kyme came to Side, they could not understand the dialect. After a short while, the influence of this indigenous tongue was so great that the newcomers forgot their native Greek and started using the language of Side. Excavations have revealed several inscriptions written in this language. The inscriptions, dating from the third and second centuries B.C., remain undeciphered, but testify that the local language was still in use several centuries after colonization. Another object found in Side excavations, a basalt column base from the seventh century B.C. and attributable to the Neo-Hittites, provides other evidence of the site's early history. The word &quot;side&quot; is Anatolian in origin and means pomegranate...Next to no information exists concerning Side under Lydia and Persian Empire sovereignty. Nevertheless, the fact that Side minted its own coins during the 547 BC while under Persian dominion, shows that it still possessed a great measure of independence..Alexander the Great occupied Side without a struggle in 333 BC. Alexander left only a single garrison behind to occupy the city. This occupation, in turn, introduced the people of Side to Hellenistic culture of the Greek Civilization, which flourished from the fourth century to the first century BC. After Alexander's death, Side fell under the control of one of Alexander's generals, Ptolemy I Soter, who declared himself king of Egypt in 305 BC. The Ptolemaic dynasty controlled Side until it was captured by the Seleucid Empire in the second century BC. Yet, despite these occupations, in the following years of the second century BC, Side managed to preserve some autonomy, grew prosperous, and became an important cultural center...In 190 BC a fleet from the Greek island city-state of Rhodes, supported by Rome and Pergamum, defeated the Seleucid King Antiochus the Great's fleet, which was under the command of the fugitive Carthaginian general, Hannibal. The defeat of Hannibal and Antiochus the Great meant that Side freed itself from the overlordship of the Seleucid Empire. The embarrassing Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) forced Antiochus the Great to abandon all European territories and to cede all of Asia Minor north of the Taurus Mountains to Pergamum. However, the dominion of Pergamum only reached de facto as far as Perga, leaving Eastern Pamphylia semi-free. This led Attalus II Philadelphus to construct a new harbour in the city Attalia (the present Antalya), even though Side already had an important harbour. Between 188 and 36 BC Side minted their own money, tetradrachms showing Nike and a laurel wreath (the sign of victory)...In the first century BC, Side reached a peak when the Cilician pirates established their chief naval base and a slave-trade center..The consul Servilius Vatia defeated these brigands in 78 BC and later the Roman general Pompey in 67 BC, bringing Side under the control of the Roman Empire. Side's second peak period started around 2C BC when it established and maintained a good working relationship with the Roman Empire.[2] Emperor Augustus reformed the state administration and placed Pamphylia and Side in the Roman province of Galatia in 25 BC, after the short reign by the king Amyntas of Galatia between 36 and 25 BC. Side began another prosperous period as a commercial center in Asia Minor through its trade in olive oil. Its population grew to 60,000 inhabitants. This period would last well into the third century AD. Side established itself as a slave-trading center in the Mediterranean. Its large commercial fleet engaged in acts of piracy. Wealthy merchants paid for such tributes as public works, monuments, and competitions as well as the games and gladiator fights. The significance of this period for Side is evident in its ruins today. Most of the present-day ruins found in Side date from this period of prosperity..Side began a steady decline from the fourth century on. Even defensive walls could not stop successive invasions of highlanders from the Taurus Mountains. During the fifth and sixth centuries, Side experienced a revival, and became the seat of the Bishopric of Eastern Pamphylia. Arab fleets, nevertheless, raided and burned Side during the seventh century, contributing to its decline. The combination of earthquakes, Christian zealots and Arab raids, left the site completely abandoned by the 10th century. [2] Its citizens had emigrated to nearby Antalya...In the twelfth century, Side temporarily established itself once more as a large city. An inscription found on the site of the former ancient city shows a considerable Jewish population in early Byzantine times. However, Side was abandoned again after being sacked. Its population moved to Antalya, and Side became known as Eski Adalia or Old Antalya and was buried..One of the maps (portolani) Piri Reis, taken from the Kitab-i Bahriye, Piri produced in several editions, supplementing in 1520, but integrating it into subsequent editions..The great ruins are among the most notable in Asia Minor. They cover a large promontory where a wall and a moat separate it from the mainland. During medieval times, the wall and moat were repaired and the promontory houses a wealth of structures...There are colossal ruins of a theater complex, the largest of Pamphylia, built much like a Roman amphitheater that relies on arches to support the sheer verticals. The Roman style was adopted because Side lacked a convenient hillside that could be hollowed out as in the usual Greek fashion more typical of Asia Minor. The theater is less well preserved than the Aspendos theater, but it is almost as large, seating 15,000 - 20,000 people. With time and the shifting of the earth, the scena wall has collapsed over the stage and the proscenium is in a cataract of loose blocks. It was converted into an open-air sanctury with two chapels during Byzantine times (5-6th c.)..The well preserved city walls provide an entrance to the site through the Hellenistic main gate (Megale Pyle) of the ancient city, although this gate from the second century BC is badly damaged. Next comes the colonnaded street although the marble columns once there do not exist anymore. All that remains is a few broken stubs near the old Roman baths. The street leads to the a public bath, restored as a museum displaying Roman period statues and sarcophagi. Next is the square agora with in the middle the remains of the round Tyche and Fortuna temple (2nd c. BC), a periptery with twelve columns. In later times it was used as a trading center where pirates sold slaves. The current remains of the theatre, which was used for gladiator fights and later as a church, and the monumental gate date back to the 2nd century. The early Roman Temple of Dionysus is near the theater. The fountain gracing the entrance is restored. At the left side are the remains of a Byzantine Basilica. A public bath has been restored[2]..The remaining ruins of Side include three temples, an aqueduct, and a nymphaeum. Side's nymphaeum – a grotto with a natural water supply dedicated to the nymphs – was an artificial grotto or fountain building of elaborate design...Turkish archaeologists have been excavating Side since 1947 and intermittently continue to do so..In 1895 Greek Muslim refugees from Crete moved to the ruined town and called it Selimiye. Today, Side has become a popular vacation destination and experiences a new revival...It was a favorite spot for watching the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006...Having been the Bishopric of Eastern Pamphylia, it is still a titular see of the Roman Catholic church.	65056	side; manavgat; turkey; ruin; history; greek; roman; temple; harleydavidson; motorbike; bike; motosiklet; motorsiklet; action; S5IS; motorcycle; turchia; türkiye; turkei; empire; attalia; arab; pamphylia; byzantine; ottoman; ancient; modern; 	A city made out of stone brick with large arches.
