Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.&quot;..My iPhone came in the mail today!  Serendipitously, I spent the afternoon on the internet researching various lists of the top iPhone apps and then when I got home, there was my new toy!..Recently I decided it was time I got myself a smartphone.  I don't really talk on my phone that much.  Mostly I use it for going on the internet, texting, and playing games, so smartphones would seem to be perfect for me.  I've been a T-Mobile customer for the past 7 years and I would've gotten a model they offered, but they decided I wasn't eligible for an upgrade discount and were going to charge me $399 for their smartphone.  Hmmm, let's see.... I could stick with T-Mobile and pay $399 for their smartphone, or I could switch to AT&amp;T and get an iPhone for $99... okay then, AT&amp;T it is!  Brilliant business model, T-Mobile...Now if I can just get the activation to kick in on my iPhone I'll be able to play around with it.  ..(August 5, 2009)..P.S. - thanks to Brian for giving me the idea for the title.	5213	iphone; apple; phone; mobile; cellular; smart; smartphone; hand; cell; Project365; 365; August 5, 2009; 	A hand holding a smart phone with apps on a screen.
